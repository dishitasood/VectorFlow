As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment.

As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments.
